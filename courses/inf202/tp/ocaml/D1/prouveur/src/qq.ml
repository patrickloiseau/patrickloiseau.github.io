(* QQ.elim is a very subtle part of the prover. 

   HOW DOES IT WORK?

   Consider the goal of proving:   ((I2 <= (N1+1)) => Q(I2)) from axiom  (QQ n, (QQ i, ((i <= (n+1)) => ((i <= n)\/(i = (n+1))))))

   During the proof intermediate goals (like G1) are made of uninstanciated variable, for instance :

     (G1)           c = (QQ ?_{24}, (?_{23} => (?_{22}\/?_{21})))  

   Then, Qq.elim makes a new intermediate goal (G2) to prove

     (G2)  QQ(x,pred x) = (QQ x, (QQ ?_{24}, (?_{23} => (?_{22}\/?_{21})))))  

   The proof of Goal G2 is obtained by unification with a clone of the axiom (QQ n, (QQ i, ((i <= (n+1)) => ((i <= n)\/(i = (n+1))))))

   Then, x:= n, ?_{24}:=i, ?_{23}:= i<=n+1, ?_{22}:=i<=n, ?_{23}:=i=n+1

   Once the proof of G2 -- that is QQ(x,pred x) -- succeeds, Qq.elim (deeply) set x to the value e provided by the prover (e is N1), thus n becomes N1

   and pred x then becomes QQ ?_{24}:=i, ?_{23}:= i<=n+1  =>  ?_{22}:=i<=n  \/  ?_{23}:=i=n+1

   Another QQ.elim with e = I2 will (deeply) instanciate ?_{24}:=i meaning that i will becomes I2.

   Due to side effects, n:=N1 and i:=I2 will impact all occurences of n and i, everywhere in the proof even in the axiom when n and i where not instanciated.
   That's why we must use clones of the proposition (that are copies with new uninstanciated variable) to store a partially instanciated proposition.
   Clones avoid the unwanted capture of variables that must remains uninstanciated.
